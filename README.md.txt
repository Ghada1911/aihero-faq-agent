## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete AI agent system built from scratch in one week. The agent allows users to search through GitHub repositories, indexing code and README files, and provides answers with direct references.

It is unique because it combines:

- A data pipeline for ingesting and processing repository data
- An AI search engine using Pydantic AI
- Evaluation metrics to measure performance
- A Streamlit web interface for interactive querying
