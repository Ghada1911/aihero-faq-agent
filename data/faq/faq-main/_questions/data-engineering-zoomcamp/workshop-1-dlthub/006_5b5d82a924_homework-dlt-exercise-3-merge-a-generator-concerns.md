### Issue:

I'm having an issue with the DLT workshop notebook, specifically in the 'Load to Parquet file' section. No matter what I change the file path to, it's still saving the DLT files directly to my C drive.

### Solution:

Use a raw string and keep the `file:///` at the start of your file path.

```python
# Set the bucket_url. We can also use a local folder
os.environ['DESTINATION__FILESYSTEM__BUCKET_URL'] = r'file:///content/.dlt/my_folder'

url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/dtc_zoomcamp_api/yellow_tripdata_2009-06.jsonl"

# Define your pipeline
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name='my_pipeline',
    destination='filesystem',
    dataset_name='mydata'
)

# Run the pipeline with the generator we created earlier.
load_info = pipeline.run(stream_download_jsonl(url), table_name="users", loader_file_format="parquet")

print(load_info)

# Get a list of all Parquet files in the specified folder
parquet_files = glob.glob('/content/.dlt/my_folder/mydata/users/*.parquet')

# Show Parquet files
for file in parquet_files:
    print(file)
```
