Try loading the data using Jupyter notebooks in a local environment. There might be bandwidth issues with Mage.

Load the data into a pandas DataFrame using the URLs, make necessary transformations, upload to the GCP bucket, or alternatively download the Parquet/CSV files locally and then upload to GCP manually.
