question: GCP FREE TRIAL ACCOUNT ERROR
sort_order: 17
---

If you're encountering an error when trying to create a GCP free trial account, and it's not related to country restrictions, credit/debit card problems, or IP issues, it might be a random problem. Hereâ€™s a workaround:

- Ask friends in your country to try signing up for the free trial using their Gmail accounts and their debit/credit cards.
- If one succeeds, you can temporarily use their Gmail to access the trial.

This method could help you bypass the issue!
