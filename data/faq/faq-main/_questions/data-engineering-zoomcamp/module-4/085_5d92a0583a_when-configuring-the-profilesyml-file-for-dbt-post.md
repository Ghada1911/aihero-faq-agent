Make sure that the port number is set as an integer in your `profiles.yml` file. Environment variables are usually strings, so you need to explicitly convert them to integers in Jinja. Update the line that sets the port with something like:

```yaml
port: {{ env_var('DB_PORT') | int }}
```

This will ensure that the value is treated as an integer.
