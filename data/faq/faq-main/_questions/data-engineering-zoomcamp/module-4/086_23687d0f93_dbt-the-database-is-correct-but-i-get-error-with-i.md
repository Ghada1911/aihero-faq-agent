question: 'DBT: The database is correct but I get Error with Incorrect Schema in Models'

What to do if your dbt model fails with an error similar to:

```
DBT-CORE
```

Check **profiles.yml**:

- Ensure your `profiles.yml` file is correctly configured with the correct schema and database under your target. This file is typically located in `~/.dbt/`.

Example configuration:

**DBT-CLOUD-IDE**

Check Credentials in dbt Cloud UI:

- Navigate to the Credentials section in the dbt Cloud project settings.
- Ensure the correct database and schema are set (e.g., ‘my_dataset’).

Verify Environment Settings:

- Double-check that you are working in the correct environment (dev, prod, etc.), as dbt Cloud allows different settings for different environments.

**No Need for profiles.yml**:

- In dbt Cloud, you don’t need to configure `profiles.yml` manually. All connection settings are handled via the UI.
