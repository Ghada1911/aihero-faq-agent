The easiest way to upload datasets from GitHub for the homework is by utilizing this script: [git_csv_to_gcs.py](https://github.com/inner-outer-space/de-zoomcamp-2024/blob/main/4-analytics-engineering/git_csv_to_gcs.py). It is similar to a script provided in `03-data-warehouse/extras/web_to_gcs.py`. <{IMAGE:image_id}>
