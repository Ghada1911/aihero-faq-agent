This error occurs when `terraform init` is run outside the working directory.

To resolve this issue:

1. Navigate to the working directory that contains your Terraform configuration files.
2. Run the `terraform init` command inside the correct directory.

Make sure your configuration files (e.g., .tf files) are present in the directory before running the command.
