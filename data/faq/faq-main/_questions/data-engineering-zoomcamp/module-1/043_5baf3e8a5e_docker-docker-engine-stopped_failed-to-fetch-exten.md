The Docker engine may crash continuously and fail to work after restart. You might see error messages like "docker engine stopped" and "failed to fetch extensions" repeatedly on the screen.

**Solution:**

- Check if you have the latest version of Docker installed. Update Docker if necessary.
- If the problem persists, consider reinstalling Docker.
  - Note: You will need to fetch images again, but there should be no other issues.
