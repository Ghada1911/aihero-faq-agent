question: 'Billing: Billing account has not been enabled for this project. But you’ve
  done it indeed!'
sort_order: 104

If you’ve got the error:

```plaintext
Error: Error updating Dataset "projects/<your-project-id>/datasets/demo_dataset": googleapi: Error 403: Billing has not been enabled for this project. Enable billing at console.cloud.google.com. The default table expiration time must be less than 60 days, billingNotEnabled
```

but you’ve set your billing account, try disabling billing for the project and enabling it again. This method has been successful for others.
