The `ny-rides.json` is your private file in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Here’s how to find it:

- Navigate to GCP and select the project with your instance.
- Go to **IAM & Admin**.
- Select the **Service Accounts** tab.
- Click the **Keys** tab.
- Add a key, choosing **JSON** as the key type, then click **Create**.

**Note:** Once in the Service Accounts, click the email associated to access the **KEYS** tab where you can add a key as a JSON key type.
