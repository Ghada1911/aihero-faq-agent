The error:

```
Error: googleapi: Error 403: terraform-trans-campus@trans-campus-410115.iam.gserviceaccount.com does not have storage.buckets.create access to the Google Cloud project. Permission 'storage.buckets.create' denied on resource (or it may not exist)., forbidden
```

The solution:

You have to declare the project name as your Project ID, not your Project name, available on the GCP console Dashboard.
