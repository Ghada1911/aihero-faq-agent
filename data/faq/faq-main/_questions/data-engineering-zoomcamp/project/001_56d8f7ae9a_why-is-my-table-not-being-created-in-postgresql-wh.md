question: Why is my table not being created in PostgreSQL when I submit a job?
sort_order: 1

There could be a few reasons for this issue:

- **Race Conditions**: If you're running multiple processes in parallel.

- **Database Connection Issues**: The job might not be connecting to the correct PostgreSQL database, or there could be authentication or permission issues preventing table creation.

- **Missing Table Creation Logic**: The code responsible for creating the table might not be properly included or executed in the job submission process.

As a best practice, it's generally recommended to pre-create tables in PostgreSQL to avoid runtime errors. This ensures the database schema is properly set up before any jobs are executed.

Extra: Use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` in your code. This will prevent errors if the table already exists and ensure smooth job execution.
