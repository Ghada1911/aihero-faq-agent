sort_order: 2
---

Each submitted project will be evaluated by three randomly assigned students who have also submitted the project.

You will also be responsible for grading projects from three fellow students yourself. Please note that not complying with this rule will result in failing to achieve the Certificate at the end of the course.

The final grade you receive will be the median score of the grades from peer reviewers.

The peer review criteria for evaluating or being evaluated must follow the guidelines defined [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_7_project#peer-review-criteria).
