There is only ONE project for this Zoomcamp. You do not need to submit or create two projects.

There are simply TWO chances to pass the course. You can use the Second Attempt if you:

- Fail the first attempt
- Do not have the time due to other engagements such as holidays or sickness to enter your project into the first attempt.

**Project Evaluation - Reproducibility**

Even with thorough documentation, ensuring that a peer reviewer can follow your steps can be challenging. Hereâ€™s how this criterion will be evaluated:

> "Ideally yes, you should try to re-run everything. But I understand that not everyone has time to do it, so if you check the code by looking at it and try to spot errors, places with missing instructions, and so on - then it's already great."

**Certificates: How do I get it?**
