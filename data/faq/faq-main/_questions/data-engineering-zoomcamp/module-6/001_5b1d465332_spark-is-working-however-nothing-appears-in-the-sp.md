Since we used multiple notebooks during the course, it's possible that there are more than one Spark session active. Itâ€™s highly likely that you are observing the incorrect one. Follow these steps to troubleshoot:

- Spark uses port 4040 by default, but if more than one session is active, it will try to use the next available port (e.g., 4041).

- Ensure you're viewing the correct Spark Web UI for the application where your jobs are running.

- Verify the current application session address:
  
  ```python
  # Using the following command in your session
  spark.sparkContext.uiWebUrl
  ```
  
  Expected output might look like:
  
  ```
  http://your.application.session.address.internal:4041
  ```
  
  Indicating port 4041.

- If using a VM, make sure you forward the identified port to access the web UI on `localhost:<port>`.
