  conflicts?

The Faust repository and library is no longer maintained - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/robinhood/faust)

If you do not know Java, you now have the option to follow the Python Videos 6.13 & 6.14 here: [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgAlVknDFlQ&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=80). Follow the RedPanda Python version here: [RedPanda Example](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/06-streaming/python/redpanda_example).

**Note:** I highly recommend watching the Java videos to understand the concept of streaming, but you can skip the coding parts. All will become clear when you get to the Python videos and RedPanda files.
