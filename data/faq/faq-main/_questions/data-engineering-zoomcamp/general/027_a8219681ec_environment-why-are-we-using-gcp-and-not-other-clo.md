For uniformity.

You can use other cloud platforms since you get every service provided by GCP in Azure and AWS. You’re not restricted to GCP and can use other platforms like AWS if you’re more comfortable.

Because everyone usually has a Google account, GCP offers a free trial period with $300 in credits for new users. Additionally, we are working with BigQuery, which is part of GCP.

Note that to sign up for a free GCP account, you must have a valid credit card.
