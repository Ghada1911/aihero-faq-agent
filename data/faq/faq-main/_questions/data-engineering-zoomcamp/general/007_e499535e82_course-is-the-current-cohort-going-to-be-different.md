For the 2025 edition, we are using Kestra (see [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0JAFvDCmSY)) instead of MageAI (Module 2). Look out for new videos. See [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEK3H8YwZn1oPPShk2p5k3E9vO-gPnUCf).

For the 2024 edition, we used Mage AI instead of Prefect and re-recorded the Terraform videos. For 2023, we used Prefect instead of Airflow. See playlists on YouTube and the [cohorts folder in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/cohorts).
