question: 'Environment: Is GCP Sandbox enough or we need the Free Trial?'

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides two free trial options: the Free Trial with $300 credit and the Sandbox. Users can switch between these options by managing billing details.

However, completing the course solely using the GCP Sandbox option is not feasible due to its limited features. The Sandbox lacks some services required for the course, such as VMs, GCS Buckets, and other paid services that are integral to the curriculum.

The course will eventually require utilizing the following:

- **VMs and GCS Buckets**: These resources are not fully available in the Sandbox.
- **BigQuery**: A key component of GCP, and the Sandbox may not support all necessary functionalities.

Therefore, it is recommended to use the GCP Free Trial with billing details to access all needed features and ensure a smooth learning experience.
