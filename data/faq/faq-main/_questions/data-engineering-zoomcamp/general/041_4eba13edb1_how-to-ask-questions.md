When the troubleshooting guide does not help resolve your issue and you need another pair of eyes, include as much information as possible when asking a question:

- What are you coding on? What operating system are you using?
- What command did you run, and which video or tutorial did you follow?
- What error did you get? Does it have a line number pointing to the problematic code, and have you checked it for typos?
- What have you tried that did not work? This is crucial because, without it, helpers might suggest steps mentioned in the error log first. Or just refer to this FAQ document.
