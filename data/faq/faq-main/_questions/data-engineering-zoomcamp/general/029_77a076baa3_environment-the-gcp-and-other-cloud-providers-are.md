You can do most of the course without a cloud. Almost everything we use (excluding BigQuery) can be run locally. We won’t be able to provide guidelines for some things, but most of the materials are runnable without GCP.

For everything in the course, there’s a local alternative. You could even do the whole course locally. Note that Homework 3 requires BigQuery.
