After you submit your homework, it will be graded based on the number of questions in that particular assignment. You can see the number of points you have earned at the top of the homework page. Additionally, in the [leaderboard](https://courses.datatalks.club/de-zoomcamp-2025/leaderboard), you will find the sum of all points you've earned: points for Homeworks, FAQs, and Learning in Public.

Point System Overview:

- **Homework:** Points vary by assignment based on the number of questions.
- **FAQ Contribution:** You get a maximum of 1 point for contributing to the FAQ in the respective week.
- **Learning in Public:** For each learning in public link, you earn one point. You can achieve a maximum of 7 points.
