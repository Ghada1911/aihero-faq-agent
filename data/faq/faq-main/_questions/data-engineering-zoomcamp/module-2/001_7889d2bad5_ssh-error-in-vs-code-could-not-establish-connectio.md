If you are using Windows, try the following steps to resolve the error:

1. Copy the `.ssh` folder from the Linux file path to Windows.
2. In the `config` file, use:
   
   ```
   IdentityFile C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\gcp
   ```
   
   Instead of:
   
   ```
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gcp
   ```

3. Ensure the private key file located at `C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\gcp` has an extra line at the end:

   <{IMAGE:image_1}>
