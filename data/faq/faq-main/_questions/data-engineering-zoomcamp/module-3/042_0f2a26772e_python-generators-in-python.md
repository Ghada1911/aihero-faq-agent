A generator is a function in Python that returns an iterator using the `yield` keyword.

A generator is a special type of iterable, similar to a list or a tuple, but with a crucial difference. Instead of creating and storing all the values in memory at once, a generator generates values on-the-fly as you iterate over it. This makes generators memory-efficient, particularly when dealing with large datasets.
