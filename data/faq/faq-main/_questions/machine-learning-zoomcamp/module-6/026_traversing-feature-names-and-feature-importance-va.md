question: Traversing feature names and feature importance values
sort_order: 26
---

To pair feature names with their importance values, use `dv.get_feature_names_out()` to retrieve the feature names and `rf.feature_importances_` for the importances. Then, combine them with `zip(feature_names, importances)` to view or sort by importance.

```python
# Assuming rf is your RandomForest model and dv is your DictVectorizer

feature_names = dv.get_feature_names_out()
feature_importances = rf.feature_importances_

# Pair feature names with their importance values
feature_importance_dict = dict(zip(feature_names, feature_importances))

# Sort by importance (optional)
sorted_feature_importance = sorted(feature_importance_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Display results
for feature, importance in sorted_feature_importance:
    print(f"{feature}: {importance}")
```
