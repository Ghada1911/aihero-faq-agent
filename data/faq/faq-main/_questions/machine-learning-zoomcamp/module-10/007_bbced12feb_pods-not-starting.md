question: 'Pods not starting'
sort_order: 7

This issue can be caused by several factors:

- **Resource Allocation:** Ensure that your Pods have enough CPU and memory resources allocated. If resources are too low, the Kubernetes scheduler might fail to schedule your Pods.

- **Image Issues:** Verify that the Docker image specified for your Pod is correctly built and accessible. If the image cannot be pulled from the repository, the Pod wonâ€™t start.
