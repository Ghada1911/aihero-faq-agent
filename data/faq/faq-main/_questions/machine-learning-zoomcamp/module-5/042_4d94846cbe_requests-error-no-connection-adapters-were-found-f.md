You need to include the protocol scheme: `[http://localhost:9696/predict](http://localhost:9696/predict)`.

Without the `http://` part, requests has no idea how to connect to the remote server.

Note that the protocol scheme must be all lowercase; if your URL starts with `HTTP://` for example, it wonâ€™t find the `http://` connection adapter either.
