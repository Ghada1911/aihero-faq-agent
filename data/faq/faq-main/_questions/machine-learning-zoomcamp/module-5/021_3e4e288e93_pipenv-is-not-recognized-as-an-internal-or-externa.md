This error occurs because `pipenv` is installed but not accessible from the PATH.

You might encounter this error when running:

```bash
pipenv --version
```

or

```bash
pipenv shell
```

### Solution for Windows:

1. Open this option:
   
   <{IMAGE:image_1}>

2. Click here:
   
   <{IMAGE:image_2}>

3. Click the Edit button:
   
   <{IMAGE:image_3}>

4. Ensure the following locations are included in the PATH. If not, add them:
   
   - `C:\Users\AppData\...\Python\PythonXX\`
   - `C:\Users\AppData\...\Python\PythonXX\Scripts\`
   
   <{IMAGE:image_4}>

**Note:** This solution is for setups without Anaconda. If you use Windows, Anaconda might be a better and less error-prone choice.
