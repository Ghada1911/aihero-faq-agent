question: Why do I get a KeyError when dropping features after one-hot encoding?
sort_order: 26

The error occurs because some features you try to drop have been one-hot encoded into multiple columns. After encoding, the original column may no longer exist, leading to the KeyError. To resolve this, identify and drop all related one-hot encoded columns (e.g., those starting with the original feature name) instead of the original feature itself.

For example, after one-hot encoding, the column `marital` could have been split into columns like `marital_single`, `marital_married`, etc. This means that the original column `marital` no longer exists, leading to the KeyError.
