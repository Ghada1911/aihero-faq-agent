question: Sparse matrix compared to dense matrix
sort_order: 14

A sparse matrix is more memory-efficient because it only stores the non-zero values and their positions in memory. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets with many zero or missing values.

The default `DictVectorizer` configuration is a sparse matrix. For Week 3, Question 6, using the default sparse configuration is beneficial due to the size of the matrix. Training the model was also more performant and didnâ€™t produce an error message like dense mode.
