You can handle missing values by:

- Imputing the missing values with the mean, median, or mode.
- Using algorithms that support missing values inherently (e.g., some tree-based methods).
- Removing rows or columns with missing data, depending on the extent of missingness.
- Utilizing feature engineering to derive new features from incomplete data.
