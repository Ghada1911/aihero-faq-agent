The template referred to in the video 8.1b [Setting up the Environment on Saturn Cloud](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/blob/master/08-deep-learning/01b-saturn-cloud.md) has been moved.

You can now find it under "Python Deep Learning Tutorials" on the Saturn Cloud homepage.

For updated text instructions (as of Nov 2024) for setting up Saturn Cloud with TensorFlow and GPU, refer to the link provided above.
