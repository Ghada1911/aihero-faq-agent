It's a complex and abstract topic and it requires some time to understand. You can move on without fully understanding the concept.

Nonetheless, it might be useful for you to rewatch the video, or even watch videos/lectures/notes by other people on this topic, as the ROC AUC is one of the most important metrics used in Binary Classification models.
