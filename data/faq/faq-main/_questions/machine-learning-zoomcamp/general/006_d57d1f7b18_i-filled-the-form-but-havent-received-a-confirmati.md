Normally, you'd receive the email shortly after you signed up.

- Check your promotions tab in Gmail as well as spam, as the email might have been filtered there.
- If you unsubscribed from our newsletter, you won't receive course-related updates.

Don't worry, it’s not a problem. To make sure you don’t miss anything, join the [#course-ml-zoomcamp channel in Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C0288NJ5XSA) and [our telegram channel with announcements](https://t.me/mlzoomcamp). This is sufficient to follow the course.
