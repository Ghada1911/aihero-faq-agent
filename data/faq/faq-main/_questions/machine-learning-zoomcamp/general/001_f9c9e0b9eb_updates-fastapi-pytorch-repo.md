question: Will the repo already have all FastAPI/uv/PyTorch updates?
sort_order: 1

The repository does not lock in every update at once. Some updates for FastAPI/uv and PyTorch are released as the cohort progresses. For theory, older videos remain; for implementation, updated workshops and videos are linked (for example, the FastAPI+uv workshop and the PyTorch add-on). To find the latest materials, check the module pages for updated workshop links. If a critical update is pushed, instructors will annotate or replace the relevant material accordingly.
