The course focuses on building and deploying real ML services, which gives you practical, portfolio-worthy projects. Business impact depends on the domain context and is best learned on the job. By the end, youâ€™ll have a visible, high-quality portfolio you can discuss with employers. For each project, consider the problem, approach, measurable outcomes, and a clear narrative to make the impact easy to communicate in interviews.
