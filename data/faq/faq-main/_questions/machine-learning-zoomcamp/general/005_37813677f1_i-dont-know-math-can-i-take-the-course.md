Math is not strictly a prerequisite to start learning machine learning (ML), but having a strong foundation in certain mathematical concepts can significantly improve your understanding and ability to work with ML models.

Yes! We'll cover some linear algebra in the course, but in general, there will be very few formulas, mostly code.

Here are some interesting videos covering linear algebra that you can already watch:

- [ML Zoomcamp 1.8 - Linear Algebra Refresher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZyKUeOR4Gg&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hIhxl5Ji8t4O6lPAOpHaCLR&index=8&ab_channel=DataTalksClub%E2%AC%9B) from Alexey Grigorev
- The excellent playlist from 3Blue1Brown: [Vectors | Chapter 1, Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)
