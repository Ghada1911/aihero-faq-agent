Yes. The program’s project-first flow, deployment modules (FastAPI/Lambda/Kubernetes), and evaluation practices map well to ML engineer roles. Practically, you’ll gain experience with end-to-end ML workflows—from data engineering pipelines and model deployment to evaluation and monitoring—using tools commonly used in DS/ML roles.
