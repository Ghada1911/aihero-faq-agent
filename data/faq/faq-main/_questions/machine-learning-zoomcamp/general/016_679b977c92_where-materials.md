All course materials and links live in the main ML Zoomcamp GitHub repository:
- Repository: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/
- Modules: folders for each unit, with a README/markdown per unit, plus videos and notes.
- Cohort-specific items (homework and dates) are under cohorts/2025.
- YouTube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hIhxl5Ji8t4O6lPAOpHaCLR contains all lessons.
- Year-specific playlists (2021â€“2025) contain cohort-specific streams and extras.
- Quick access tips: browse the repo, check the modules folders, and look in cohorts/2025 for cohort-specific items. The syllabus is also available in the course repo mlzoomcamp.com/#syllabus.
