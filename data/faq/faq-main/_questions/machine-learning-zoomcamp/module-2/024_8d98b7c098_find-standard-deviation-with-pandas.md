question: Find standard deviation with Pandas
sort_order: 24

To find the standard deviation of a list or series of data using Pandas, you can convert the list into a Pandas Series and use the `.std()` function. For example:

```python
import pandas as pd

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
standard_deviation = pd.Series(x).std()
print(standard_deviation)
```

This will calculate the standard deviation of the list `x`.
