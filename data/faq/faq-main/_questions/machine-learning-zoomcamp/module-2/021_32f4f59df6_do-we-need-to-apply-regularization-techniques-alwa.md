  scenarios?

The application of regularization depends on the specific situation and problem. It is recommended to consider it when training machine learning models, especially with small datasets or complex models, to prevent overfitting. However, its necessity varies depending on the data quality and size. Evaluate each case individually to determine if it is needed.
