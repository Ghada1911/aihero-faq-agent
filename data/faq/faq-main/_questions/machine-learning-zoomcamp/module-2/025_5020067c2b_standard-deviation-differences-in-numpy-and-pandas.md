question: Standard Deviation Differences in Numpy and Pandas
sort_order: 25
---

Numpy and Pandas use different equations to compute the standard deviation. Numpy uses the population standard deviation by default, whereas Pandas uses the sample standard deviation.

### Numpy

<{IMAGE:image_1}>

### Pandas

<{IMAGE:image_2}>

Pandas computes the standard deviation using one degree of freedom by default. You can modify the degree of freedom in Numpy to achieve a similar result by using the `ddof` parameter:

```python
import numpy as np

np.std(df.weight, ddof=1)
```

The result will be similar if we set `ddof=1` in Numpy.
