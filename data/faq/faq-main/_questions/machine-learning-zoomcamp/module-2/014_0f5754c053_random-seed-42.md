question: Random seed 42
sort_order: 14

One of the questions on the homework calls for using a random seed of 42. When using 42, all my missing values ended up in my training dataframe and not my validation or test dataframes, why is that?

The purpose of the seed value is to randomly generate the proportion split. Using a seed of 42 ensures that all learners are on the same page by getting the same behavior (in this case, all missing values ending up in the training dataframe). If using a different seed value (e.g. 9), missing values will then appear in all other dataframes.
