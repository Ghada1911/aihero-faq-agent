question: Can I do the course in other languages, like R or Scala?

Technically, yes. Advisable? Not really. Here are the reasons:

- Some homework assignments require specific Python library versions.
- Answers may not align with multiple-choice questions if using languages other than Python 3.10 (the recommended version for the 2023 cohort).
- For midterms or capstones, your peer-reviewers may not know these other languages, which could lead to issues in scoring and feedback.
- While you can create a separate repository using the course lessons in other languages for personal learning, it is not recommended for official submissions.
