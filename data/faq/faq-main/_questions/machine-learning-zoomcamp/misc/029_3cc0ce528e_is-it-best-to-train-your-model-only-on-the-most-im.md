question: Is it best to train your model only on the most important features?

Not necessarily. While some features may show higher importance, it's essential to consider the predictive value of all features. Here are a few guidelines:

- **Evaluate Predictive Value**: Include features that offer additional predictive value. Test your model with and without certain features. If excluding a feature decreases performance, it should be retained.
- **Correlation Consideration**: Some important features might be highly correlated with others. It may be fine to drop some correlated features if they do not improve model performance.
- **Feature Selection Algorithms**: Consider using feature selection methods like L1 regularization (Lasso), which implicitly selects features by shrinking some weights to zero.

Refer to the lessons in week 3 of the churn prediction project for more insights, especially around feature importance for categorical values. Specifically, lesson 3.6 discusses mutual info scores, and lesson 3.10 demonstrates training a Logistic Regression model on all categorical variables.
