There are different techniques, but the most commonly used are the following:

- **Dataset Transformation**: Apply transformations such as log transformation to normalize data.
- **Clipping High Values**: Limit the range of data by capping extremes.
- **Dropping Observations**: Remove the outlier observations from the dataset.
