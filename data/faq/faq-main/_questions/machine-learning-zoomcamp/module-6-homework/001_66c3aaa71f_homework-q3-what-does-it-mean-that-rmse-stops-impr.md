question: 'Homework Q3: What does it mean that RMSE stops improving?'
sort_order: 1

Question 3 of homework 6 if I see that RMSE goes up at a certain
number of `n_estimators` but then goes back down lower than it was before, should
the answer be the number of `n_estimators` after which RMSE initially went up, or
the number after which it was its overall lowest value?

When RMSE stops improving, it means when it stops decreasing or remains nearly the same.
