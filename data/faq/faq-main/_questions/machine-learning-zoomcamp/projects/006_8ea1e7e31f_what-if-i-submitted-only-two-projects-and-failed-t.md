sort_order: 6

- You must pass 2 out of the 3 projects to earn the certificate: Midterm + Capstone 1, or Capstone 1 + Capstone 2.
- Certificates show pass/fail only—no percentage or rank.
- Eligibility for the certificate also follows the existing two-project policy: If you have submitted two projects and peer-reviewed at least 3 course-mates’ projects for each submission, you will receive the certificate. According to the course coordinator, only two projects are needed to get the course certificate.
- Are projects solo or collaborative? All midterms and capstones are solo projects.
- Grading basis: The pass decision is based on the scores across projects; no overall percentage or rank is awarded.
