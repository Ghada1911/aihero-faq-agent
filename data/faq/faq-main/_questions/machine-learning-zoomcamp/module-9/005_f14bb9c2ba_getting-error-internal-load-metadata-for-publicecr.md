This error is produced sometimes when building your Docker image from the Amazon Python base image.

### Solution Description:

The following could solve the problem:

- **Update Docker Desktop**: Ensure you have the latest version installed.
- **Restart Docker and Terminal**: Try restarting Docker Desktop and your terminal application, then build the image again.
- **Disable BuildKit**: If the above steps do not work, run the following command to disable Docker BuildKit and build your image:
  
  ```bash
  DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build .
  ```
