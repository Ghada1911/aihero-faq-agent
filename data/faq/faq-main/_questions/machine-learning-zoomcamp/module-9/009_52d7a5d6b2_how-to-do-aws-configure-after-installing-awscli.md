question: How to do AWS configure after installing awscli

In video 9.6, after installing `awscli`, we should configure it with `aws configure`. It asks for Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default Region Name, and Default Output Format. What should we put for Default Output Format? Is leaving it as None okay?

Yes, you can leave everything as the provided defaults (except for the Access Key and the Secret Access Key).
