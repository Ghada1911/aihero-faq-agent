To check your file size using the PowerShell terminal, you can use the following command lines:

```powershell
$File = Get-Item -Path path_to_file
$fileSize = (Get-Item -Path $File).Length
```

Now you can check the size of your file, for example in MB:

```powershell
Write-Host "MB: " ($fileSize/1MB)
```
