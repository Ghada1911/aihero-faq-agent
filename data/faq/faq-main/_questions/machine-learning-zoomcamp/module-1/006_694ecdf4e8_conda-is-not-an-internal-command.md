If you encounter an issue where the command:

```bash
conda create -n ml-zoomcamp python=3.13
```

doesn't work, try the following solutions:

1. **Use Anaconda Prompt:**
   - If you are on Windows, use Anaconda's own terminal called "Anaconda Prompt". This should automatically configure your environment to recognize Conda commands.

2. **Install Anaconda or Miniconda:**
   - If you do not have Anaconda or Miniconda installed, download and install one of them first.

Note: Any version of Python starting from 3.10 should be suitable.
