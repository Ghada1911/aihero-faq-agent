If you have a Windows 11 device and would like to use the built-in WSL to access Linux, you can use the Microsoft Learn link [Set up a WSL development environment | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment).

To connect this to VS Code, download the Microsoft verified VS Code extension ‘WSL’. This will allow you to remotely connect to your WSL Ubuntu instance as if it were a virtual machine.
