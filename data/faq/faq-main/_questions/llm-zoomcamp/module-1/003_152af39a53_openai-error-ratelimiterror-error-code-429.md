```json
RateLimitError: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors.)', 'type': 'insufficient_quota', 'param': None, 'code': 'insufficient_quota'}
```

The above errors are related to your OpenAI API account’s quota. There is no free usage of OpenAI’s API, so you will need to add funds using a credit card (see pay-as-you-go in the OpenAI settings at [platform.openai.com](http://platform.openai.com)). Once added, re-run your Python command and you should receive a successful return code.

Steps to resolve:

1. Add credits to your account [here](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) (min $5).
2. In `chat.completions.create(model='gpt-4o', …)` specify one of the models available to you:

   <{IMAGE:image_1}>

3. You might need to recreate an API key after adding credits to your account and update it locally.
