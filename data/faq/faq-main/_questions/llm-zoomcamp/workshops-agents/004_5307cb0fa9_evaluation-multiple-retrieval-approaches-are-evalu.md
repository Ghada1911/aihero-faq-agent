question: 'Evaluation: Multiple retrieval approaches are evaluated, and the best one
  is used (2 points). I am trying to evaluate a project. The person used only minsearch
  for evaluation but applied boosting and posted the boosting parameter. Do they get
  one mark?'

The evaluation criteria state that to receive 2 points, multiple RAG approaches must be evaluated, and the best one must be used. Since the individual is using only minsearch for evaluation, despite applying boosting, this does not qualify as evaluating multiple RAG approaches.

Therefore, they would receive only 1 point for utilizing a single RAG approach (minsearch) in their evaluation, even though they incorporated a boosting parameter. Boosting itself does not constitute a separate approach; it is simply an enhancement applied to the single method being used.
