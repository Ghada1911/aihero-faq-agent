question: 'How to Solve "RuntimeError: Already running asyncio in this thread"'

Jupyter notebooks already run an event loop in the main thread to handle asynchronous code. For this reason, when you try to call `asyncio.run()` inside a cell, you get the following error:

```plaintext
RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop
```

Instead of using `asyncio.run()`, simply use `await` directly in the notebook cell.

**Incorrect:**

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with Client(weather_server.mcp) as mcp_client:
        # your code here

# This will cause the RuntimeError
result = asyncio.run(main())
```

**Correct:**

```python
async def main():
    async with Client(weather_server.mcp) as mcp_client:
        # your code here

# Use await directly
result = await main()
```

Jupyter notebooks automatically create an asyncio event loop when they start. Since `asyncio.run()` attempts to create a new event loop, it conflicts with the existing loop. By using `await` directly, you leverage the already running event loop.
