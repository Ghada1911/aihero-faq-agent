You only need to submit one project. If the submission at the first attempt fails, you can improve it and re-submit during the attempt 2 submission window.

- If you want to submit two projects for the experience and exposure, you must use different datasets and problem statements.
- If you canâ€™t make it to the attempt 1 submission window, you still have time to catch up to meet the attempt 2 submission window.

Remember that the submission does not count towards the certification if you do not participate in the peer review of three peers in your cohort.
