question: How is my capstone project going to be evaluated?
sort_order: 4
---

Each submitted project will be evaluated by three randomly assigned students who have also submitted the project.

You will also be responsible for grading the projects of three fellow students yourself. Please be aware that not complying with this rule will result in failing to achieve the Certificate at the end of the course.

The final grade you receive will be the median score of the grades from the peer reviewers.

The peer review criteria for evaluation must follow the guidelines defined here (TBA for link).
