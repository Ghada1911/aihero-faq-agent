question: Protobuf error when installing MLflow
sort_order: 21
---

### Error:

I installed all the libraries from the `requirements.txt` document in a new environment with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, when I run `mlflow` from my terminal like this:

```bash
mlflow
```

I get this error:

<{IMAGE:image_1}>

### Solution:

You need to downgrade the version of the `protobuf` module to 3.20.x or lower. Initially, it was version 4.21. Use the following command to install the compatible version:

```bash
pip install protobuf==3.20
```

After doing this, I was able to run `mlflow` from my terminal.
