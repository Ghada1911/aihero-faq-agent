**Problem:** Open/run GitHub notebook (.ipynb) directly in Google Colab

**Solution:**

- Change the domain from `github.com` to `githubtocolab.com`. The notebook will open in Google Colab.
- Note: This only works with public repositories.

Navigating in Wandb UI became difficult to me, I had to intuit some options until I found the correct one.

**Solution:** Refer to the official documentation.
