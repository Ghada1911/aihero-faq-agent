You might need to use the green taxi data rather than yellow taxi data. The preprocessing code provided with the homework expects green taxi data (even though the question specifies yellow taxi data). Using green taxi data seems to be the correct approach, based on similar questions. Note that there is no official confirmation of this yet (as of early morning, May 27th in Berlin).
