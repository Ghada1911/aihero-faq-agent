It really depends on how much time and effort you can dedicate to the project over the coming weeks. Since you're late for the homeworks and they aren't required for the certificate, it might make sense to focus on the projects. Even if the first attempt is a struggle, it will be the best preparation for a second attempt, should you need or want one.
