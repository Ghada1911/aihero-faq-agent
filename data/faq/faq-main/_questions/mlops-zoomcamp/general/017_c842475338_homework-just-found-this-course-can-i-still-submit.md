question: 'Homework: Just found this course, can I still submit homeworks?'

To clarify on **late homework submissions**:

- You cannot submit after the homework is scored, as the form is closed.
- Once the form is closed (i.e., scored), no further submissions are possible.
- You can check your code against the solution by reviewing the `homework.md` file.

If the due date has passed but the form is still "Open/Submittable":

- This is considered a "late homework submission," and the form is still editable.
- Donâ€™t forget to click the Update button to save any changes.

Please note, it's uncertain when the form will be closed as this process is currently manual.
