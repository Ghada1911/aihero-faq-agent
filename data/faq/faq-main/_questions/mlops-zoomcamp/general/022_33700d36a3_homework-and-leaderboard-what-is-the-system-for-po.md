After you submit your homework, it will be graded based on the number of questions in that particular homework. You can see how many points you have on the homework page at the top.

In the leaderboard, you will find the sum of all points you've earned, which include:

- Points for Homeworks
- Points for FAQs
- Points for Learning in Public

If you submit something to the FAQ, you receive one point. For each Learning in Public link, you also get one point. Hover over the "?" for some explanations.
