question: Mage in Codespaces

The below errors seem to occur only when using Mage in Codespaces.

### Errors

1. **Error (1)**
   
   ```bash
   Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
   ```

2. **Error (2)**
   
   ```bash
   Error response from daemon: invalid volume specification: '/workspaces/mage-mlops:/:rw': invalid mount config for type "bind": invalid specification: destination can't be '/'
   ```

   **Solution for (1) & (2):**
   
   - Stay tuned…still testing.
   - Running `docker info` and `docker –version` works fine. 
   - Executing `docker compose down`, stopping Codespaces, and reconnecting resolved the errors, though it might not be reproducible for everyone.

3. **Error (3)**

   ```bash
   warning: unable to access '/home/codespace/.gitconfig': Is a directory
   ```

   **Solution (3):**

   - This is targeted for 3.5.x Deploying with Mage. If not deploying:
     - Comment line #20 in `docker-compose.yml`.
     - Place a dummy empty file named `.gitconfig` in your repo’s root folder.
     - Copy it in the Dockerfile with this line, place it below line #9:

       ```dockerfile
       COPY .gitconfig /root/.gitconfig
       ```

   - The reason this happens is that when the file is missing, Docker auto-creates it as a directory instead of a file. Creating a dummy file prevents this.
