- Ensure when stopping an EC2 instance that it fully stops. Look for the status indicator: green (running), orange (stopping), and red (stopped). Refresh the page to confirm it shows a red circle and status as stopped.
  
- Note that stopping an EC2 instance might still incur charges, such as storage costs for uploaded data on an EBS volume.
  
- Consider setting up billing alerts to monitor costs. However, specific instructions for setting them up are not provided here.
