question: 'Visualizing outliers in large datasets with Seaborn: Boxplot vs Histplot'
sort_order: 51

`seaborn.boxplot` is generally faster because it uses a smaller set of summary statistics (min, Q1, median, Q3, max) to represent the data, which requires less computational effort, especially for large datasets.

`seaborn.histplot` can be slower, particularly with large datasets, because it needs to bin the data and compute frequency counts for each bin, which involves more processing.

So, if speed is a concern, especially with large datasets, boxplots are typically faster than histograms.
