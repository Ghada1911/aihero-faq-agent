Yes, you can submit and update your project attempts multiple times before the final deadline.

- It is advisable not to wait until the last minute. Submitting even a partially completed project early allows you to make improvements over time.
- Continue adding improvements as needed until the final date.
- Simply update the Git commit SHA to reflect changes.
