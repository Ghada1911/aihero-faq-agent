In case you want to set up a GitHub repository (e.g., for homeworks) from a remote VM, you can follow these helpful tutorials:

- **Setting up GitHub on AWS instance:** [Tutorial](https://gist.github.com/matthewoden/b29353e266c554e04be8ea2058bcc2a0)
- **Setting up keys on AWS instance:** [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

Once you complete these steps, you should be able to push to your repository successfully.

**AWS Instance Note:**

The selected AWS instance may not be covered under the free tier due to its size or other factors. Here is what the AWS free tier includes:

- Resizable compute capacity in the Cloud.
- 750 hours per month of Linux, RHEL, or SLES t2.micro or t3.micro* instance, depending on the region.
- 750 hours per month of Windows t2.micro or t3.micro* instance, depending on the region.
- 750 hours per month of public IPv4 address regardless of the instance type.

*Instances launch in Unlimited mode and may incur additional charges.
