If you’re struggling to set things up "locally" (meaning non-managed environments like your laptop, a VM, or Codespaces), you can follow this guide to use Spark in Google Colab:

[Launch Spark on Google Colab and Connect to SparkUI](https://medium.com/gitconnected/launch-spark-on-google-colab-and-connect-to-sparkui-342cad19b304)

Starter notebook:

[GitHub Repository - Spark in Colab](https://github.com/aaalexlit/medium_articles/blob/main/Spark_in_Colab.ipynb)

It’s advisable to spend some time setting up locally rather than using this solution immediately.
