  100 rows. I ran again with the variable value specified but my table still has 100

Remove the dataset from BigQuery created by dbt and run again (with test disabled) to ensure the dataset created has all the rows.

DBT: Why am I getting a new dataset after running my CI/CD Job? / What is this new dbt dataset in BigQuery?

When you create the CI/CD job, under 'Compare Changes against an environment (Deferral)' make sure that you select 'No; do not defer to another environment'. Otherwise, dbt won’t merge your dev models into production models; it will create a new environment called ‘dbt_cloud_pr_number of pull request’
