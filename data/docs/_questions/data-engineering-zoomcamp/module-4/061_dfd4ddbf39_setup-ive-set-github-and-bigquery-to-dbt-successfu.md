Before you can develop some data model on dbt, you should:

1. **Create a Development Environment:** Ensure that your development environment is properly configured.
   
2. **Set Parameters:** Specify necessary parameters within the environment.
   
Once the model has been developed, also create a deployment environment to create and run jobs.
