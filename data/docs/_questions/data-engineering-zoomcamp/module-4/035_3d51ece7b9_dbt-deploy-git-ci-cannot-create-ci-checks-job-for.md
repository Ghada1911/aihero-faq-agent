**Error:**

```
Triggered by pull requests

This feature is only available for dbt repositories connected through dbt Cloud's native integration with Github, Gitlab, or Azure DevOps
```

**Solution:**

Contrary to the [guide on DTC repo](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/04-analytics-engineering/dbt_cloud_setup.md), donâ€™t use the Git Clone option. Use the Github one instead. A step-by-step guide to unlink Git Clone and relink with Github is available in the next entry.
