question: 'DBT Deploy: This dbt Cloud run was cancelled because a valid dbt project
  was not found.'
sort_order: 67

This issue occurs when the dbt project is moved to another directory in the repository or if you're on a different branch than expected.

**Solution:**

1. Navigate to the projects window on dbt Cloud.
2. Go to Settings -> Edit.
3. Add the directory path where the dbt project is located. Ensure that this path matches your file explorer path. For example:
   
   ```
   /week5/taxi_rides_ny
   ```

4. Check that there are no files waiting to be committed to GitHub if youâ€™re running the job to deploy to PROD.

5. Ensure the PROD environment is set up to check the main branch, or the specified branch.

In the image below, the branch "ella2024" is set to be checked as "production-ready" by the "freshness" check mark in PROD environment settings. Each time a branch is merged into "ella2024" and a PR is triggered, the CI check job initiates. Note that merging and closing the PR must be done manually.

6. Set up the PROD custom branch (if not the default main) in the Environment setup screen.
