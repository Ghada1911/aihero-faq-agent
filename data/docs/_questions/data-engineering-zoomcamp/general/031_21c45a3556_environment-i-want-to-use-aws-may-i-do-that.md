Yes, you can. Just remember to adapt all the information from the videos to AWS. Additionally, the final capstone will be evaluated based on these tasks:

- Create a data pipeline
- Develop a visualization

Consider that when seeking help, you might need to rely on fellow coursemates who use AWS, which could be fewer compared to those using GCP.
