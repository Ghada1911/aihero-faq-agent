question: Is it possible to use tool “X” instead of the one tool you use in the course?

Yes, this applies if you want to use Airflow or Prefect instead of Mage, AWS or Snowflake instead of GCP products, or Tableau instead of Metabase or Google Data Studio.

The course covers two alternative data stacks: one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.

Considerations:
- We can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack.
- You would need to explain the different choices of tools for the peer review of your capstone project.
