There'll be an announcement in Telegram and the course channel for:

- Checking that your full name is displayed correctly on the Certificate (see Editing course profile on the Course Management webpage).
- Notifying when the grading is completed.

You will find it in your course profile (you need to be
logged it). 

For 2025 the link to the course profile is this:

`https://courses.datatalks.club/de-zoomcamp-2025/enrollment`

For other editions, change "2025" to your edition.

After the second announcement, follow instructions in [certificates.md](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/certificates.md) on how to generate the Certificate document yourself.
