There are multiple Zoomcamps in a year, as of 2025. More info at [DTC Article](https://datatalks.club/blog/guide-to-free-online-courses-at-datatalks-club.html).

They are five separate courses, estimated to be during these months:

- **Data-Engineering**: Jan - Apr
- **Stock Market Analytics**: Apr - May
- **MLOps**: May - Aug
- **LLM**: June - Sep
- **Machine Learning**: Sep - Jan

There's only one Data-Engineering Zoomcamp “live” cohort per year for the certification, similar to the other Zoomcamps. They follow pretty much the same schedule for each cohort. For Data-Engineering, it is generally from Jan-Apr of the year. 

If you’re not interested in the Certificate, you can take any Zoomcamp at any time, at your own pace, out of sync with any “live” cohort.
