You can set it up on your laptop or PC if you prefer to work locally. However, Windows users might face some challenges.

If you prefer to work on the local machine, you can start with the Week 1 Introduction to Docker.

Alternatively, if you prefer to set up a virtual machine, consider the following:

- **Using GitHub Codespaces**
- **Setting up the environment on a cloud VM**: Refer to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae-CV2KfoN0&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb) for guidance.

Working on a virtual machine is beneficial if you have different devices for home and office, allowing you to work virtually anywhere.
