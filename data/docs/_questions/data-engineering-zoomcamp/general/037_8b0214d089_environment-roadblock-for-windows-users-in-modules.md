question: 'Environment: Roadblock for Windows users in modules with *.sh (shell scripts)'

Later modules (module-05 & RisingWave workshop) use shell scripts in *.sh files. Most Windows users not using WSL will encounter issues and may not be able to continue, even in Git Bash or MINGW64. It is recommended to set up a WSL environment from the start.
