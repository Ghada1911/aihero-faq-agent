Technically you can use any code editor or Jupyter Notebook, as long as you can run dbt and answer the homework questions. A lot of code is provided by the instructor on the homework page to give you a head start in the right direction: [dlt Homework Instructions](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2025/workshops/dlt/dlt_homework.md).

The most practical way is to use the provided Colabs Jupyter notebook called ‘dlt - Homework.ipynb’ which you can find here: [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1plqdl33K_HkVx0E0nGJrrkEUssStQsW7#scrollTo=BtsSxtFfXQs3) since all of the provided code is applicable in the Colabs set-up.
