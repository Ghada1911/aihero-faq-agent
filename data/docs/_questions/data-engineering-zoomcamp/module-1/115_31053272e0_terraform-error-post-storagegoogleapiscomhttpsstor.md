The issue was related to network restrictions, as Google is not accessible in my country. I used a VPN and discovered that the terminal program does not automatically follow the system proxy, requiring separate proxy configuration settings.

**Solution:**

1. Open an Enhanced Mode in your VPN application, such as Clash.
2. Run `terraform apply` again.

If you encounter this issue, consult your VPN provider for assistance with configuration.
