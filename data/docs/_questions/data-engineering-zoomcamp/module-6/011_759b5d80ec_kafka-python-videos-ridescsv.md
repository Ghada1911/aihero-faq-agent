There is no clear explanation of the `rides.csv` data that the `producer.py` Python programs use. You can find it here: [Rides CSV File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/2bd33e89906181e424f7b12a299b70b19b7cfcd5/week_6_stream_processing/python/resources/rides.csv).
