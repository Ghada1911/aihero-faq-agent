If you get this error, it means you have not built your Spark and Jupyter images. These images arenâ€™t readily available on DockerHub.

To resolve this:

- In the Spark folder, run the following command from a bash CLI to build all images before running docker compose:
  
  ```bash
  ./build.sh
  ```
