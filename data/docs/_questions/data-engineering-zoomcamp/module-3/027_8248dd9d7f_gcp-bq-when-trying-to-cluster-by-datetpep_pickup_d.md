No need to convert as you can cluster by a TIMESTAMP column directly in BigQuery. BigQuery supports clustering on TIMESTAMP, DATE, DATETIME, STRING, INT64, and BOOL types.

Clustering sorts data based on the timestamp to optimize queries with filters like `WHERE tpep_pickup_datetime BETWEEN ...`, rather than creating discrete partitions.

If your goal is to improve performance for time-based queries, combining partitioning by `DATE(event_time)` and clustering by `tpep_pickup_datetime` is a good approach.
