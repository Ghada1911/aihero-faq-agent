- **Check the Schema**: Ensure that the schema of your dataset is correctly defined.

- **Formatting Issues**: You might have incorrect formatting in your files.

- **Upload Method**: Try uploading the CSV.GZ files without formatting or processing them through pandas. Use `wget` to download if necessary.
