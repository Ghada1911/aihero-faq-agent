**Solution:**

Proceed with setting up `serving_dir` on your computer as described in the `extract_model.md` file. Then, instead of using:

```bash
docker pull tensorflow/serving
```

use:

```bash
docker pull emacski/tensorflow-serving
```

Then run:

```bash
docker run -p 8500:8500 -p 8501:8501 --mount type=bind,source=`pwd`/serving_dir/tip_model,target=/models/tip_model -e MODEL_NAME=tip_model -t emacski/tensorflow-serving
```

After that, run the `curl` command as instructed, and you should get a prediction.
