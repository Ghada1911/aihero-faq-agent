  based on my research. How can we estimate the number of OpenAI tokens asked in homework
  question 6?'

The question asks for the number of tokens in the GPT-4o model. `tiktoken` is a Python library that can be used to get the number of tokens. You don't need an OpenAI API key to get the number of tokens. You can use the code provided in the question to get the number of tokens.
