question: Server Error (500) When logging in to course homework using GitHub
sort_order: 12

Additional error text seen:

```
Third-Party Login Failure

An error occurred while attempting to login via your third-party account.
```

The current solution is to use Google or Slack to log in and submit homework answers, as the root cause analysis for the GitHub issue is sporadic and doesnâ€™t impact all users.
