No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a "live" cohort.

We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review 3 capstone(s) after submitting your project.

You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running; after the form is closed and the peer-review list is compiled.
