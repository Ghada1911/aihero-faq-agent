Check the quota and reset cycle carefully. Is the free hours limit per month or per week? Usually, if you change the configuration, the free hours quota might also be adjusted, or it might be billed separately.

Potential options include:

- Google Colab
- Kaggle
- Databricks (possibly)

Consider using GPTs to discover more options. Be aware that some platforms might have restrictions on what you can and cannot install, so ensure to read what is included in the free vs paid tier.
