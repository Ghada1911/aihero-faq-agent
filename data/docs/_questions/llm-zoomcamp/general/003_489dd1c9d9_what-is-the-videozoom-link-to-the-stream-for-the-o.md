The zoom link is only published to instructors/presenters/TAs.

Students participate via YouTube Live and submit questions to Slido (link is pinned in the chat when live). The video URL should be posted in the [announcements channel on Telegram & Slack](https://t.me/dezoomcamp) before it begins. You can also watch live on the DataTalksClub [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DataTalksClub).

Don’t post questions in chat as they may be missed if the room is very active.
