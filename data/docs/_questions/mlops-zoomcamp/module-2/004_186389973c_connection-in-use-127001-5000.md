You have something running on the 5000 port. You need to stop it. Here are some ways to resolve the issue:

- **Using Terminal on Mac**:
  1. Run the command:
     ```bash
     ps -A | grep gunicorn
     ```
  2. Identify the process ID (the first number after running the command).
  3. Kill the process using the ID:
     ```bash
     kill 13580
     ```
     where `13580` represents the process number.

  <{IMAGE:image_1}>

- **To Kill All Processes Using Port 5000**:
  ```bash
  sudo fuser -k 5000/tcp
  ```

- **Alternative Command to Kill the Running Port**:
  ```bash
  kill -9 $(ps -A | grep python | awk '{print $1}')
  ```

- **Change to a Different Port**:
  ```bash
  mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --port 5001
  ```
