If you’re using a Postgres backend locally or remotely and don’t want to delete the entire backend, you can run this script to permanently delete an experiment. This script assumes you have a separate `env.py` file to retrieve your environment variables.

```python
import os
import sys
import psycopg2

sys.path.insert(0, os.getcwd())
from env import DB_NAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_PORT, DB_USER

def perm_delete_exp():
    connection = psycopg2.connect(
        database=DB_NAME,
        user=DB_USER,
        password=DB_PASSWORD,
        host="localhost",
        port=int(DB_PORT)
    )
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        queries = """
        DELETE FROM experiment_tags WHERE experiment_id=ANY(SELECT experiment_id FROM experiments where lifecycle_stage='deleted');
        DELETE FROM latest_metrics WHERE run_uuid=ANY(SELECT run_uuid FROM runs WHERE experiment_id=ANY(SELECT experiment_id FROM experiments where lifecycle_stage='deleted'));
        DELETE FROM metrics WHERE run_uuid=ANY(SELECT run_uuid FROM runs WHERE experiment_id=ANY(SELECT experiment_id FROM experiments where lifecycle_stage='deleted'));
        DELETE FROM tags WHERE run_uuid=ANY(SELECT run_uuid FROM runs WHERE experiment_id=ANY(SELECT experiment_id FROM experiments where lifecycle_stage='deleted'));
        DELETE FROM params WHERE run_uuid=ANY(SELECT run_uuid FROM runs where experiment_id=ANY(SELECT experiment_id FROM experiments where lifecycle_stage='deleted'));
        DELETE FROM runs WHERE experiment_id=ANY(SELECT experiment_id FROM experiments where lifecycle_stage='deleted');
        DELETE FROM datasets WHERE experiment_id=ANY(SELECT experiment_id FROM experiments where lifecycle_stage='deleted');
        DELETE FROM experiments where lifecycle_stage='deleted';
        """
        for query in queries.splitlines()[1:-1]:
            cursor.execute(query.strip())
    connection.commit()
    connection.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    perm_delete_exp()
```
