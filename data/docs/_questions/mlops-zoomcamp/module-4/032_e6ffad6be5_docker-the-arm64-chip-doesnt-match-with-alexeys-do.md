You may get a warning similar to the one below when trying to run the docker:

```
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested

Python 3.10.13 (main, Mar 12 2024, 12:22:40) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
```

Add the tag `--platform linux/amd64` when running, and it should work. For example:

```bash
docker run -it --platform linux/amd64 --rm -p 9696:9696 homework:v2
```
