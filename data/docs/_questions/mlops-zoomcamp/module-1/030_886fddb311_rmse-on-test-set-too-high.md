question: RMSE on test set too high
sort_order: 30

### Problem

RMSE on the test set was too high when hot encoding the validation set using a previously fitted `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')` on the training set. In contrast, `DictVectorizer` yielded the correct RMSE.

### Explanation

In principle, both transformers should behave identically when treating categorical features, especially in scenarios where there are no sequences of strings in each row (as in this weekâ€™s homework):

- Features are put into binary columns encoding their presence (1) or absence (0).
- Unknown categories are imputed as zeros in the hot-encoded matrix.

This discrepancy indicates that there might be a difference in how `OneHotEncoder` and `DictVectorizer` handle the data after fitting on the training set and applying to the validation set.
