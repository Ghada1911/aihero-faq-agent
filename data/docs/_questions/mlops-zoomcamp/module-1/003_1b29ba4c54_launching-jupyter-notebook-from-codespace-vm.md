When you are ready and have installed Anaconda, you can launch a Jupyter notebook in a new terminal with the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Be careful not to make any typos. For instance, entering "jupyter-notebook" will result in an error:

```bash
Jupyter command `jupyter-notebook` not found.
```
