The course videos are pre-recorded, and you can start watching the course right now.

The zoomcamps are spread out throughout the year. See the article [Guide to Free Online Courses at DataTalks Club](https://datatalks.club/blog/guide-to-free-online-courses-at-datatalks-club.html).

We will also occasionally have office hours — live sessions where we will answer your questions. The office hours sessions are recorded too.

You can see the office hours (playlist with year 20xx) as well as the pre-recorded course videos in the Course Channel’s Bookmarks and/or [DTC’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DataTalksClub/playlists).
