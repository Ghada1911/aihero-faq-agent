No matter if you're with a 'live' cohort or following in self-paced mode, start by:

- Reading pins and bookmarks on the course channel to see what things are where.

- Reading the repository (bookmarked in channel) and watching the video lessons (playlist bookmarked in channel).

- If you have questions, search the channel itself first; someone may have already asked and gotten a solution.

- For the most Frequently Asked Questions, refer to this document:

- If you don't want to read/skimmer/search the FAQ document, tag the `@ZoomcampQABot` when asking questions, and it will summarize answers from its knowledge base.

- For generic, non-zoomcamp queries, consider using tools like ChatGPT, BingCopilot, or Google Gemini, especially for error messages.

- Check if you're on track by checking the deadlines in the Course Management form for homework submissions.

The main difference if you're not in a "live" cohort is that responses to your questions might be delayed because fewer active students are online. This won't be an issue if you do your own due diligence by searching for answers first and reading the documentation of the library.

- If you need to ask questions and the resources above haven't helped, follow the guidelines in the `asking-questions.md` document (bookmarked in channel) and also check the Pins.
