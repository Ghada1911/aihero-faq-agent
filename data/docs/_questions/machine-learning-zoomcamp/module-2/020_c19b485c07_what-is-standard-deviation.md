One of the most important characteristics of the normal distribution is that mean = median = mode, meaning the most popular value, the mean of the distribution, and 50% of the sample are under the same value. This is equivalent to saying that the area under the curve (black) is the same on the left and on the right. The long tail (red curve) results from a few observations with high values, altering the behavior of the distribution. Consequently, the area is different on each side, and the mean, median, and mode become different. The mean is no longer representative, the range is larger, and the probability of being on the left or right is not the same.

In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.
