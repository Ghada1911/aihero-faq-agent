question: Target variable transformation

Why should we transform the target variable to logarithm distribution? Do we do this for all machine learning projects?

Only if you see that your target is highly skewed. The easiest way to evaluate this is by plotting the distribution of the target variable.

Transforming to a logarithmic scale can help address skewness and improve the distribution of your data set.

For more information, you can refer to [Skewness on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness).
