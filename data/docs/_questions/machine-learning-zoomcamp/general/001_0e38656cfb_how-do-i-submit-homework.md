- Do the tasks locally
- Publish your code (e.g., in your own GitHub repo)
- Submit your answers via the homework form and include the URL to your code
- You will see the answers only after the deadline
- Homeworks are in the cohorts folder, e.g. for 2025 it's [`cohorts/2025`](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master/cohorts/2025)
- The forms for submitting the homework are in the [course management platform](https://courses.datatalks.club/)
