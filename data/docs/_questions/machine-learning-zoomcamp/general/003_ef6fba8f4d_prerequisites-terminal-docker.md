- Be ready to use the terminal. You’ll use Git, the command line, Docker, and basic OS tasks. These are demonstrated in the course, but you should be comfortable running commands and reading errors.
- If you’re new to any of these tools, consider a quick hands-on practice session before the course starts.
- You don’t need to master everything before day one, but a basic comfort level with the command line will help you keep up as you learn.
