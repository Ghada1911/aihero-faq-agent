question: Submitting learning in public links
sort_order: 19
---

When you post about what you learned from the course on your social media pages, use the tag `#mlzoomcamp`. When you submit your homework, there’s a section in the form for putting the links there. Separate multiple links by any whitespace character (linebreak, space, tab, etc).

- For posting the learning in public links, you get extra scores.
- The number of scores is limited to 7 points: if you put more than 7 links in your homework form, you’ll get only 7 points.
- The same content can be posted to 7 different social sites and still earn you 7 points if you add 7 URLs per week.

For midterms/capstones, the awarded points are doubled as the duration is longer. So for projects, the points are capped at 14 for 14 URLs.
