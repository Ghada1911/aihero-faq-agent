question: How much theory will you cover?
sort_order: 4

The bare minimum. The focus is more on practice, and we'll cover the theory only on the intuitive level.

For example, we won't derive the gradient update rule for logistic regression (there are other great courses for that), but we'll cover how to use logistic regression and make sense of the results.
