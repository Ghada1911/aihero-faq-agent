The course is available in a self-paced mode, allowing you to go through the materials anytime. If you prefer to join a cohort with other students, live cohorts start every September.

Zoomcamps are scheduled throughout the year. For more information, refer to [A Guide to Free Online Courses at DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/blog/guide-to-free-online-courses-at-datatalks-club.html).

Course videos are pre-recorded and available to watch immediately. We also occasionally host office hours for live Q&A, which are recorded and made available later. You can find these recordings and pre-recorded course videos on the Course Channel’s Bookmarks or [DTC’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DataTalksClub/playlists).
