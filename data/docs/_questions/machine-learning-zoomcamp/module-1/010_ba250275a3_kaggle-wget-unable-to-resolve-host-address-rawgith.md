In Kaggle, when you attempt to `!wget` a dataset from GitHub or any other public repository, you might encounter the following error:

```
--2022-09-17 16:55:24--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/housing.csv
Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... failed: Temporary failure in name resolution.
wget: unable to resolve host address 'raw.githubusercontent.com'
```

### Solution:

- In your Kaggle notebook settings, enable internet access for your session. This option is found in the settings panel on the right-hand side of the Kaggle screen.
- You will need to verify your phone number to confirm you are not a bot.
