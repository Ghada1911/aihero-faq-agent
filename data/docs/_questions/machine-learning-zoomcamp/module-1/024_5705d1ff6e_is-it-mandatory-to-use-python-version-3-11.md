No, Python 3.11 is not strictly mandatory for the course. You have flexibility in choosing your Python version, but here are some important considerations:

**Recommended versions:** (as of 2025)
- Python 3.10 or later is recommended for best compatibility
- Python 3.11 and 3.12 work well with all course materials
- Python 3.13 should also work fine for most use cases

**Version compatibility check:**
You can verify if your Python version is still supported and secure by checking:
https://endoflife.date/python

This website shows which Python versions are:
- Currently supported with security updates
- In maintenance mode (security fixes only)
- End-of-life (no longer receiving updates)

**Why version matters:**
- Newer Python versions include performance improvements and new features
- Some libraries used in the course may require minimum Python versions
- Using a supported version ensures you receive security updates
- Consistency with course materials helps avoid compatibility issues

**How to check your version:**
```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

As long as you're using Python 3.10 or later and it's not end-of-life, you should be able to complete all course exercises successfully.
