question: Uploading the homework to Github
sort_order: 4
---

If you encounter the following error when trying to use Git for the first time:

```bash
error: src refspec master does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/XXXXXX/1st-Homework.git'
```

Solution:

1. Make an initial commit using:
   
   ```bash
   git commit -m "initial commit"
   ```

2. Push to the main branch instead:
   
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

For a comprehensive guide on using GitHub, visit [GitHub Quickstart](https://dennisivy.com/github-quickstart).

You can also use GitHub's "upload file" feature, or share your Google Colab notebooks directly to GitHub:
