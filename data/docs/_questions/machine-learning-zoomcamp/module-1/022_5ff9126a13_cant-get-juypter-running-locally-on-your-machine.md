If you’re struggling to get a Jupyter notebook running locally on your machine or have other issues (like only having a cellphone available), consider using the following online platforms that don't require installation:

- [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/)
- [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/index.html)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
