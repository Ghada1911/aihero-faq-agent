question: Any advice for adding the Machine Learning Zoomcamp experience to your LinkedIn
  profile?

I've seen LinkedIn users list DataTalksClub as Experience with titles such as:

- Machine Learning Fellow
- Machine Learning Student
- Machine Learning Participant
- Machine Learning Trainee

It is advised not to list this experience as an official job or internship since DataTalksClub did not hire or financially compensate you.

Consider incorporating the experience in the following sections:

- Organizations
- Projects
- Skills
- Featured
- Original posts
- Certifications
- Courses

Interesting suggestion: Add the link of your project to your CV as a showcase and make posts to show your progress.
