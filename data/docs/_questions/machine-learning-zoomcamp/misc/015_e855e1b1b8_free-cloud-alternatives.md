question: Free cloud alternatives
sort_order: 15
---

I tried deploying my Docker image on Render, but it won't work. I get `SIGTERM` every time.

I think 0.5GB RAM is not enough. Is there any other free alternative available?

There are several free alternatives:

- **AWS (Amazon)** and **GCP (Google)**: Both offer free micro instances for an extended period along with additional free resources.
- **Saturn Cloud**: Provides free GPU instances. Recent promotional information for Saturn Cloud is available for ML Zoomcamp participants:
  
  "You can sign up here: [https://bit.ly/saturn-mlzoomcamp](https://bit.ly/saturn-mlzoomcamp)

  When you sign up, write in the chat box that you're an ML Zoomcamp student and you should get extra GPU hours (around 150)."
