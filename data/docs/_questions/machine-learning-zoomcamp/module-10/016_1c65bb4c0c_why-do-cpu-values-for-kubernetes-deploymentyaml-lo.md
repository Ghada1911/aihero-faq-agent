question: Why do CPU values for Kubernetes deployment.yaml look like "100m" and "500m"?
  What does "m" mean?

In Kubernetes resource specifications, such as CPU requests and limits, the "m" stands for milliCPU, which is a unit of computing power. It represents one thousandth of a CPU core.

- `cpu: "100m"` means the container is requesting 100 milliCPUs, which is equivalent to 0.1 CPU core.
- `cpu: "500m"` means the container has a CPU limit of 500 milliCPUs, which is equivalent to 0.5 CPU core.

These values are specified in milliCPUs to allow fine-grained control over CPU resources. It allows you to express CPU requirements and limits in a more granular way, especially in scenarios where your application might not need a full CPU core.
