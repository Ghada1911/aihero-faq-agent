question: 'Homework: is the RMSE result close to the options?'

My result is about 12.4 different from the closest option. For previous questions, my answers were close, so I'm unsure why there's a large discrepancy for question 6.

For questions 5 and 6, please ensure you reinitialize with:

```python
Idx = np.arange(n)
```

This should be done for each iteration of `r` in question 5 and also for question 6.
