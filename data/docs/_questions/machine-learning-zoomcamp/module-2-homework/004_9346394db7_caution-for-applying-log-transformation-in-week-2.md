sort_order: 4
---

The instruction for applying log transformation to the ‘median_house_value’ variable is provided before Q3 in the homework for Week-2 under the ‘Prepare and split the dataset’ heading.

However, this instruction is absent in the subsequent questions of the homework, and you might encounter issues like a huge RMSE. Remember to apply log transformation to the target variable for each question.
