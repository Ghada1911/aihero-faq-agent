I'm getting "ValueError: multi_class must be in ('ovo', 'ovr')" when using `roc_auc_score` to evaluate feature importance of numerical variables in question 1.

This error occurs because the parameters were passed to `roc_auc_score` incorrectly. Here is the correct usage:

```python
roc_auc_score(y_train, df_train[col])
```
