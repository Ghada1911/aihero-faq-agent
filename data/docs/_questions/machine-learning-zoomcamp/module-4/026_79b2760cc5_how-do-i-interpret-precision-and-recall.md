**Precision:**

Memory tip: Think of Precision as "How Precise Are Our Positive Predictions?" It relates to the accuracy of the positive results, emphasizing how many of the predicted positive instances are actually correct.

**Interpretation:**

- **High Precision:**
  - Most of the predicted positives are correct.
  - This makes the model more reliable.

- **Low Precision:**
  - Indicates a higher rate of false positives.
  - This decreases trust in the positive predictions.

**When to prioritize precision:** In scenarios like email spam detection, where marking a legitimate email as spam (false positive) can lead to missed communications, high precision is preferred to ensure that most flagged emails are indeed spam.

**Recall:**

Memory tip: Think of Recall as "How Sensitive Are We to the Positives?" It emphasizes capturing all actual positive cases. A high recall means that the model is good at identifying most of the positives.

**Interpretation:**

- **High Recall:**
  - The model captures most of the true positives.
  - This is crucial in situations where missing a positive case is costly.

- **Low Recall:**
  - Many actual positives are overlooked.
  - This highlights potential issues in detection.

**When to prioritize recall:** In medical diagnostics for a severe or highly contagious disease, missing a true positive (an actual case of the disease) can have serious public health implications.

**Balancing Precision and Recall:**

- Improving one metric may lead to a decrease in the other.
- The choice between precision and recall depends on specific goals and acceptable trade-offs in a given application.
