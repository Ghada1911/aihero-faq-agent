In Module 4, youâ€™ll learn the core evaluation concepts used in classification tasks. Topics include:
- Metrics and diagnostics: precision, recall, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves
- Evaluation mindsets: how to think critically about metrics and validation in ML projects
- Common pitfalls: data leakage, improper validation, misinterpretation of metrics and curves
- Practical interpretation: selecting metrics based on context (class balance, costs of errors) and conveying results clearly
- Real-world applicability: how these concepts guide model comparison, threshold selection, and reporting
This module is designed to be conceptual and abstract, yet practical for real-world ML work.
