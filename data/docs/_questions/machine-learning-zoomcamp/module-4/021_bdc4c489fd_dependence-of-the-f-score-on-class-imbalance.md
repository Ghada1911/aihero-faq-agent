question: Dependence of the F-score on class imbalance
sort_order: 21
---

Precision-recall curves, and thus the F-score, explicitly depend on the ratio of positive to negative test cases. This means that comparing the F-score across different problems with differing class ratios can be problematic. 

One way to address this issue is to use a standard class ratio when making such comparisons.
