For multiclass classification, it is important to keep class balance when you split the dataset. Stratified k-fold returns folds that contain approximately the same percentage of samples of each class.

Please check the implementation in the scikit-learn library: [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#stratified-k-fold](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#stratified-k-fold)
