question: How to ensure "none" values are not interpreted as NaN when reading a CSV
  file in Pandas

To ensure that the string values like "None" are treated as valid strings rather than being converted to NaN when reading a CSV file, you can read the CSV file with `keep_default_na` set to `False` and specify the values you want to consider as NaN with the `na_values` parameter.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to do this:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("dataset_path.csv", keep_default_na=False, na_values=['', 'NaN', 'null'])
```

Using `keep_default_na=False` prevents Pandas from applying its default set of NaN values, allowing "None" to be read as a regular string.
