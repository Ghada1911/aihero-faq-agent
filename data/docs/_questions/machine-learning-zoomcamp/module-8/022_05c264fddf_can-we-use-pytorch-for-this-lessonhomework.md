PyTorch is also a deep learning framework that allows you to perform equivalent tasks as Keras. Here is a tutorial to create a CNN from scratch using PyTorch:

The functions have similar goals, although the syntax may vary slightly. For the lessons and the homework, we use Keras, but you are free to make a pull request with the equivalent implementation using PyTorch for the lessons and homework!
