Keras `flow_from_directory` understands the names of classes from the names of folders.


- When using `train_gen.flow_from_directory()`, the class names are derived from the folder names within the specified directory.
- For example, if you create a folder named "xyz", it will be considered a class.
- This behavior aligns with the function name `flow_from_directory`.
