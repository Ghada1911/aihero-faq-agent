question: 'Homework Q6: Choosing smaller C that leads to best accuracy'
sort_order: 6

When searching for the best value of `C` that yields the highest accuracy, be mindful that you should be looking for the maximum accuracy, not the minimum.

Although the goal is to find the smallest `C` value, ensure that it corresponds to the highest accuracy achieved. Always prioritize accuracy maximization while minimizing `C`.
