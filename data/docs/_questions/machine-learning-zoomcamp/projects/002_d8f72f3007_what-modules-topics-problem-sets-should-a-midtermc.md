Ideally, midterms should cover up to module-06, while capstone projects should include all modules in the cohortâ€™s syllabus. However, you can include any other topics you wish to feature. Ensure that you document anything not covered in class.

Also, consider watching office hours from previous cohorts. Visit the DTC YouTube channel, click on Playlists, and search for {course yyyy}. ML Zoomcamp was first launched in 2021.
