question: Learning in public links for the projects
sort_order: 4

For the learning in public for this midterm project, it seems the total value is 14. Does this mean that we need to make 14 posts, or the regular seven posts for each module, each one with a value of 2? Or just one with a total value of 14?

- You need to make 14 posts: one for each day and another 2 posts for evaluating other participants' projects.
