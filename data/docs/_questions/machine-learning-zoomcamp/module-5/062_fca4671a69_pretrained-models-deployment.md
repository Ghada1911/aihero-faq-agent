question: Can I use pre-trained models and focus on deployment?

Yes, you can use pre-trained models and focus on deployment, but you must include some training element (such as fine-tuning, retraining, or a comparable approach). Without a training element, youâ€™ll lose points in training-related criteria, though you can still pass overall if other parts are strong.
