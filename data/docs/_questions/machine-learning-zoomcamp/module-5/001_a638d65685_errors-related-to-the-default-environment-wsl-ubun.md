While weeks 1-4 can relatively easily be followed and the associated homework completed with just about any default environment or local setup, week 5 introduces several layers of abstraction and dependencies.

It is advised to prepare your “homework environment” with a cloud provider of your choice. A thorough step-by-step guide for doing so for an AWS EC2 instance is provided in an introductory video taken from the MLOPS course here:

Note that (only) small instances can be run for free, and larger ones will be billed hourly based on usage (but can and should be stopped when not in use).
